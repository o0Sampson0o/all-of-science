			<h2>Thales of Miletus: A Biological Summary</h2>
			<p>
				Thales of Miletus (c. 624-546 BCE) was an ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer, often regarded as one of the Seven
				Sages of Greece and the first philosopher in the Western tradition. Here&apos;s a concise summary of his life and contributions:
			</p>

			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Birthplace:</strong> Miletus, an Ionian city in present-day Turkey.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Background:</strong> Though details about his life are scarce, Thales likely came from a wealthy family and may have
					traveled to Egypt and Babylon, where he was influenced by their mathematical and astronomical knowledge.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Philosophical Contributions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Natural Philosophy:</strong> Thales sought to explain the world through natural causes rather than mythology. He proposed
					that <em>water</em> was the fundamental substance (<em>arche</em>) from which everything originated, based on observations of
					water&apos;s role in life and its changing states.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Cosmology:</strong> He viewed the Earth as a flat disk floating on a vast sea of water. While incorrect, this idea marked
					an attempt to describe the cosmos logically.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Prediction of a Solar Eclipse:</strong> Thales is famously credited with predicting the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BCE,
					showcasing his understanding of celestial patterns.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Mathematical Contributions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Thales introduced geometry to Greece, possibly learning it from the Egyptians. Some theorems in geometry, such as{" "}
					<strong>Thales&apos; theorem</strong> (about angles in a semicircle), are named after him.
				</li>
				<li>He is thought to have used geometry to measure the height of pyramids by comparing their shadows to his own.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Legacy</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Influence:</strong> Thales&apos; shift from mythological to rational explanations inspired subsequent philosophers like
					Anaximander and Anaximenes.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>&ldquo;Father of Philosophy&rdquo;:</strong> Aristotle considered him the founder of natural philosophy due to his focus
					on material causes.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Thales&apos; work marks the beginning of <strong>scientific inquiry</strong> in the Western world, laying the foundation for physics,
				astronomy, and mathematics.
