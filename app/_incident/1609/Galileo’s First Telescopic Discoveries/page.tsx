			Using a telescope he built, Galileo Galilei observed celestial phenomena that revolutionized astronomy. He discovered the craters and
			mountains on the Moon, the four largest moons of Jupiter (now called the Galilean moons), the phases of Venus, and countless stars
			invisible to the naked eye. These observations provided strong evidence against the geocentric model of the universe and supported the
			heliocentric theory proposed by Copernicus. Galileo&apos;s findings challenged prevailing scientific and religious beliefs, laying the
			foundation for modern observational astronomy.
