			Isaac Newton, during his time at Woolsthorpe Manor, conducted an experiment with a glass prism. He passed sunlight through the prism and
			observed that it split into a spectrum of colors, proving that white light is composed of multiple colors. He also recombined the colors
			with a second prism to show they formed white light again, revolutionizing the understanding of optics.
