			Maupertuis proposed the principle of least action, asserting that natural processes minimize a quantity called &ldquot;action.&rdquo; This
			groundbreaking idea suggested that nature operates in the most efficient way possible. His formulation was a pivotal development in
			physics, influencing fields like classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and optics. The principle was presented in his essay, &ldquo;The
			Laws of Motion and Rest deduced from a Metaphysical Principle,&rdquo; marking a significant moment in the history of analytical mechanics.
